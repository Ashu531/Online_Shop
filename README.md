# Online_Shop
This is the project where user can get the whole experience of a e-commerce website 
which includes fully operational CRUD such as 
selecting the product, 
adding to cart, 
update and 
deleting the choices. 
This project is made by using Node.js and 
express framework 
where MongoDb is used. 
For frontend I have used a handlebar i.e Pug.
